        <h4>Guests of The Roosevelt Room will marvel at the attention to detail and incredible interior of Liberty Center's first bar only concept. The space is modeled entirely after 26th U.S. President, Teddy Roosevelt. A mural adorns the entrance wall featuring a rearing horse, paying homage to Roosevelt's position as Lieutenant Colonel of the Rough Riders. The craft cocktail list furthers the Roosevelt theme with Mint Juleps and a robust tap list. Have a seat at the bar and admire the ambiance.</h4>
